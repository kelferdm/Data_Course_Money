##1.  Create a new R script as part of your Assignment 4 R-project. Name it "Assignment_4.R"
##2.  That script should do the following:
##  + Read in the file: "/Data/ITS_mapping.csv"   ...good luck with that, hahaha!
##  + Somehow summarize all of the columns and do a bit of additional exploration (play with some functions)
##+ Make a boxplot where "Ecosystem"" is on the x-axis and "Lat" is on the y-axis
  ##  + Write code to export this boxplot to a new file in your Assignment_4 directory called "silly_boxplot.png"
##      Hints on below ...
##3.  Make sure to save your completed script and Rproject and make sure your png file is saved correctly
##4.  Push all these saved changes and new files onto your GitHub repository so I can grade them
##5.  Don't forget the plaintext file with answers to bolded questions needs to go to Canvas as well!
